# atom-theme-galley

for Version 2:
apply syntax manually to code block
https://github.com/MoOx/atom-syntax-theme-to-highlights-css

# Setup:
https://render.com/docs/deploy-create-react-app

This app uses render to render a static react app page
I chose this to create a quick front end that will interact with a json django api

all pushes to the repository (main branch) will automatically be deployed to server.
